                  The present work expects an efficient and secure data transmission scheme to exchange information from a 
                  vehicle to other devices (i.e., V2X communication) and vice versa. Besides the security incorporation, 
                  this project enhances vehicle communication through different communication technologies, such as DSRC, 
                  LTE, 4G/5G, WiMAX, etc. The heterogeneous vehicular network framework of IoV has significant potential 
                  to guide and supervise vehicles. It provides a reliable communication platform for abundant mobile Internet 
                  and multimedia related applications. The realization of heterogeneous vehicular network architecture is a 
                  challenging task. Furthermore, the consumers can enjoy several benefits of the proposed IoV network 
                  architecture for onboard computations and communications capable vehicles. The proposed work will be compared 
                  with existing technologies in terms of functionalities, such as reliability, user experience, and communication 
                  speed. The project is designed for three years. In the first year, a comprehensive analysis will be done to 
                  identify various new and existing threats under different security specifications, which enables us to formulate 
                  concrete research problems, thereby a robust data exchange strategy. Besides, we will start the architecture 
                  design of the proposed work in the second half of this year. In the second year, we will finish all the schemes 
                  construction with their formal security analyses. In the third year, we will unite all the cryptographic 
                  solutions to develop an application to measure the realization of this work. We believe that this new project 
                  will begin a new extent in vehicular communication in the future.

                  In order to ensure the efficiency of the various systems that make up a smart city, it is imperative that there 
                  exist protocols that maintain robust connectivity and allow secure and fast information transfer between the 
                  IoT devices involved in the communication process. One of the important needs comes from bandwidth allocation 
                  to IoT devices. As IoT devices are expected to grow in large numbers, it will be difficult to allocate spectrum 
                  bands to these devices. Fixed spectrum assignment policy requires the cost to purchase spectrum therefore spectrum 
                  assignment for such a large number of devices can create unnecessary expenditures. Also, the number of licensed 
                  users also called Primary Users i.e., PUs will also increase, and the spectrum is a limited resource that will 
                  not be able to fulfill the future demands. Since traditional communication techniques do not support spectrum 
                  sharing using opportunistic spectrum access, CRNs can be one of the potential solutions and facilities in all 
                  of these situations using dynamic spectrum access. Hence, CRN enabled IoT may perceive the spectrum environment 
                  and fulfill the spectrum demand of IoT applications. LTE and 5G network has some drawbacks of outreach in the 
                  urban area, but with the CRN framework, we can use different frequency to reach the maximum number of devices 
                  and users.

                  There is a serious mismatch between the growing traffic volume and the availability of resources to support 
                  the traffic. Some of the important reasons for this mismatch are rapid development of our economy, increased 
                  affordability of our society, multiple vehicles per family, and so on. We believe that the mismatch will 
                  continue to grow and adversely affect our traffic infrastructure unless efficient traffic management solutions 
                  that include security are developed and deployed. This proposal is a step in this direction. The end product 
                  of our research will be an efficient secured traffic management scheme which will deploy a significant amount 
                  of automation in a cost-effective manner. Since the communication component of our scheme will use a mixture 
                  of wired and wireless channels, our security mechanism will protect it from security threats which will bound 
                  to happen. Our investigation and solution development will keep in mind the state of our transport fabric (city 
                  roads, highways, intersections, etc.) and traffic management policies to make our solution deployable.

                  The IoV can be considered as a convergence of the mobile Internet and the traditional IoT. As a huge network 
                  of interactions, IoV technology refers to dynamic mobile communication systems or models that communicate 
                  between vehicles and other objects using V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle), V2R (vehicle-to-road), V2I 
                  (vehicle-to-infrastructure), V2B (vehicle -to-building), V2H (vehicle-to-home), V2X (vehicle-to-everything), 
                  V2G (vehicle-to-grid), and V2H (vehicle-to-home) interactions. It also allows information exchanges between 
                  V2D (vehicle-to-device), V2S (vehicle-to-sensor) and D2D (device-to-device) within a vehicle. Deployment of 
                  the IoV in smart cities enables information sharing and the gathering of Big data information on vehicles, 
                  roads, infrastructure, buildings, and their surroundings. The IoV ecosystem can provide services for intelligent 
                  transportation applications to guide and supervise vehicles, and provide abundant multimedia and mobile Internet 
                  application services.

                  In this era of modern technology, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is rapidly growing technology. The IoV 
                  provides intelligent transportation systems (ITS) by magnifying the capabilities of the vehicular ad hoc 
                  network (VANET) using the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT). In IoV vehicles, roadside units (RSU), 
                  infrastructure are interconnected and exchange information with minimum or zero human intervention. This 
                  autonomous nature of IoV requires strong authentication for each entity to recognize each other, as well 
                  as these entities, should ensure the integrity of the exchanged information. Otherwise, this autonomy will 
                  attract malicious users and malicious activity. Due to the dynamic nature of the IoV network, it is almost 
                  impossible to solve the security issue with the centralized authentication system. To solve this problem, 
                  in this paper, we propose a Blockchain-enabled secure communication and authentication method for the Internet 
                  of Vehicles (IoV), called IoVChain. We have used cryptographic functions (i.e., elliptic curve digital signature 
                  algorithm (ECDSA), secure hash algorithm (SHA256)) in combination with blockchain concept for secure 
                  communication, securing stored data and authentication of participating IoV devices (e.g., vehicles). We 
                  evaluate experimental results by comparing IoVChain with the existing state-of-the-art scheme, and the outcomes 
                  exhibit that the proposed scheme improved performance in terms of reducing computational time, storage 
                  requirements, and communication cost of IoV. Security analysis exhibits the strength of the scheme against 
                  various security attacks.

                  VANET is an important component of Inter-vehicular communication (IVC) which is an emerging research area that 
                  has the potential to contribute to traffic safety. It helps to establish inter-vehicle communication for 
                  synchronizing their movement, especially at the road intersections. Many IVC applications have the common need 
                  for fast multihop message propagation, including information such as position, direction, and speed. Thus, like 
                  many other data-intensive systems (banks, defence organizations, etc.), it is crucial for IVC to be resilient 
                  to security attacks. Since hackers have abounded, we make this issue as one of the major research and development 
                  components of this proposal. We summarize the objective of the proposal as “To investigate the 
                  V2V(Vehicle-to-Vehicle) network infrastructure and develop a secured, trustworthy and reliable scheme to achieve 
                  secured V2V communication”.

                  Recently, the usage of Internet of things (IoT) devices has been extensively increased in real-life applications, 
                  because these devices help to increase decision making capability and reduce human effort, energy requirement, 
                  and time to complete different tasks. Further, the vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) offers many safety and 
                  non-safety applications for nearby individuals and objects, which has revolutionized in vehicular communication 
                  systems. Consequentially, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) came into the picture in which various IoT devices and 
                  VANET components are connected to exchange data (e.g., real-time traffic, vehicle service and update, driving 
                  behaviour, advertisement, toll payment credentials, usage-based insurance, etc.) on the fly. However, we think 
                  that we can enhance IoV architecture by connecting different technological systems to develop new smart city 
                  applications and to have cutting-edge business opportunities.

                  The concept of vehicular Adhoc networks(VANETs) has a high level of connectivity to vehicles and, along with 
                  novel Onboard Unit(OBU) computing and sensing technologies, serve as a key enabler of smart transportation

                  Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning(ML) technologies, it is helping pave the road to autonomous driving in 
                  the advent of the 5G and beyond networks. In VANETs, the V2V, V2R and V2I communication based on the DSRC (IEEE 
                  802.11p) protocols. To address the limitations of IEEE 802.11p based technologies and leverage the high 
                  penetration rate of cellular networks, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has started to investigate 
                  supporting vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services in the long term evolution (LTE) network and the future 5G and 
                  beyond networks. As a prevailing approach to AI, machine learning, in particular deep learning, has drawn 
                  considerable attention in recent years due to its astonishing progress in such areas as image classification, 
                  Driving Pattern classification, and video game playing. It helps build intelligent systems to operate in 
                  complicated environments and has found many successful applications in computer vision, and AR/VR. Machine 
                  learning develops efficient methods to model and analyzes large volumes of data by finding patterns and 
                  underlying structures and represents an effective data-driven approach to problems encountered in various 
                  scientific fields where heterogeneous types of data are available for exploitation. As a result, machine 
                  learning provides a rich set of tools that can be leveraged to exploit the data generated and stored in 
                  vehicular networks and help the network make more informed and data-driven decisions. However, how to adapt 
                  and exploit such tools to account for the distinctive characteristics of high mobility vehicular networks and 
                  serve the purpose of reliable vehicular communications remains challenging and represents a promising research 
                  direction.
